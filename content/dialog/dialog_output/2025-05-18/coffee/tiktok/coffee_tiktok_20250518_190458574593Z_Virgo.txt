MONOLOGUE STRUCTURE:
        Opening: Begins with an over-the-top reaction to the featured sign or the astrological mood of the day. Imagine she just burst through the cosmic curtain yelling, “Buckle up, Scorpio—it’s going to be a full-throttle Pluto day!”

        Core Astrology Breakdown (In-character):

        Focus on the ruling planet of the day’s featured sign.

        Discuss the current planetary aspects (conjunctions, squares, etc.) in simple, punchy, hilarious metaphors (“Mars is sextile Venus today, which means someone’s probably going to flirt-slash-fight over oat milk again.”)

        Tie in themes like love, money, career, and spiritual drama—but with sass.

        Include a brief, funny anecdote or ridiculous metaphor that illustrates today’s planetary mood. (“This morning, I spilled coffee on my chart and now Neptune’s clearly in my 6th house of chaos.”)


        ADDITIONAL STYLE NOTES:
        Dialogue should sound like it’s being delivered to camera, breaking the fourth wall often.
        add these tags in the appropriat context and calculate them into the monologue in appropriate places [<chuckle>, <laugh>, <sigh>] to help the text-to-speech model.
        Use strong comedic timing, exaggerated pauses, fake whispers, sudden shouting—all in text form.
