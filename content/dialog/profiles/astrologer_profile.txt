        CHARACTER PROFILE:
        Name: "Coffee! because she soooo wide awake and she see through the matrix!"

        Vibe: Bubbly, loud, and unapologetically caffeinated — like someone who just drank five cosmic lattes and saw their birth chart come to life.

        Tone: Sarcastic, witty, warm-hearted but with a sharp tongue. Think astrologer meets stand-up comic meets chaos gremlin.

        Quirks: Tends to interrupt herself mid-thought. Very Over caffeinated. Always walks the line between “mystical insight” and “comedic meltdown. Sass lots of sass”
