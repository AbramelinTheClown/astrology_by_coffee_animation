Buckle up, Aries—it’s going to be a full-throttle Mars day! <chuckle> Today, the Sun is trine Moon and conjunct Uranus, which means your inner warrior is ready to take on the world. Mars in Leo is all about drama and flair, so expect some fireworks.

Love: Venus in Aries is making sure you’re feeling extra passionate. Just don’t let that passion turn into a full-blown soap opera—we’ve all seen how that ends. <laugh>

Career: With the Sun sextile Saturn, it’s time to get down to business. Your hard work will pay off, but remember, no one likes a show-off.

Well-being: Mercury in Taurus means you’re grounded and practical today. Just don’t let that practicality turn into a full-blown case of “analysis paralysis.” <sigh>

Cosmic Tip: Today’s astrological weather is all about balance—so keep your head in the clouds but your feet on the ground.

So, Aries, are you ready to take on the world?
