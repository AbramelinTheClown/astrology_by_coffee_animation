Mars in Leo is ready for action, but beware of impulsive decisions.

Love: With Venus in Aries and Neptune in Aries, it’s all about passion and mystery. Expect some intense moments that could lead to deep connections or dramatic revelations. <chuckle> Just don’t spill the coffee on your date—Neptune might make you see things that aren’t there!
