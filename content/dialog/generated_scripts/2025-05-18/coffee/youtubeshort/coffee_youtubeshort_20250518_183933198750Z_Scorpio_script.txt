Buckle up, Scorpio—it’s going to be a full-throttle Pluto day! <chuckle> Today, the cosmic weather is all about stability and unexpected twists. The Sun is trine Moon, which means you’re feeling grounded but also ready to shake things up.

Pluto, your ruling planet, is in Aquarius, stirring up some revolutionary vibes. With the Sun conjunct Uranus, expect the unexpected—like finding a hidden treasure in your closet or getting an out-of-the-blue job offer. <laugh> This morning, I spilled coffee on my chart and now Neptune’s clearly in my 6th house of chaos.

In love, Venus in Aries is making you feel fiery and passionate. But be careful, Mars in Leo might make you a bit too dramatic—think Shakespearean levels of drama. Career-wise, the Sun sextile Saturn means it’s time to get serious about your goals. Well-being? Jupiter in Gemini has you feeling chatty and curious, so dive into that book you’ve been meaning to read.

Cosmic Tip: Embrace the chaos today, Scorpio. It might feel like a rollercoaster, but remember, every twist and turn is leading you closer to your destiny.

So, buckle up again, because this Pluto day is just getting started! <sigh>
