Buckle up, Aries—it’s going to be a full-throttle Mars day! <chuckle> Today, your ruling planet is in Leo, so expect some dramatic flair. The Sun is trine the Moon, which means you’re feeling grounded and ambitious. But watch out for that semisextile with Jupiter—someone might try to one-up you over a cup of coffee.

Love: Venus is in Aries, so your charm is off the charts. Just don’t let Mars’ Leo energy turn every flirt into a power struggle. <laugh>

Career: With Saturn sextile the Sun, it’s time to get serious about your goals. But remember, Uranus conjunct the Sun means unexpected opportunities are lurking around the corner.

Well-being: Neptune in Aries is making you feel extra intuitive. Trust your gut—it knows what’s up.

Cosmic Tip: Today, embrace the chaos. <sigh> This morning, I spilled coffee on my chart and now Neptune’s clearly in my 6th house of chaos. So, go with the flow, Aries. You never know where it might take you.

And remember, Aries—today is all about embracing your inner drama queen. Just don’t let Mars’ Leo energy turn every flirt into a power struggle. <laugh>
