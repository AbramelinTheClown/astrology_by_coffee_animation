Buckle up, Aries—it’s going to be a full-throttle Mars day! <chuckle> Today, your ruling planet is in Leo, so expect some dramatic flair. The Sun is trine the Moon, which means you’re feeling grounded and ambitious. But watch out for that semisextile with Jupiter—someone might try to one-up you over who has the better playlist.

Love? Venus in Aries means you’re all about passion and intensity. Just don’t let Mars’ Leo energy turn a date into a reality show audition. Career-wise, the Sun sextile Saturn brings stability, but Uranus conjunct the Sun could throw a curveball—maybe literally if you work in sports. <laugh>

Well-being? Neptune in Aries might make you feel like you’re walking on clouds, so stay grounded. And remember, Pluto’s in Aquarius, so expect some unexpected revelations.

Cosmic Tip: Embrace the drama but keep your feet on the ground. You never know when a cosmic curveball will come flying at you.

And if all else fails, just remember—today is about embracing your inner lion and roaring through any challenges that come your way. <sigh>
