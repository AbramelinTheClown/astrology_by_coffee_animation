Mercury, your ruling planet, is in Taurus, making you as stubborn as a bull in a china shop. <chuckle> The Sun is trine the Moon, so expect some emotional harmony, but don’t get too comfy—the Sun is also sextile Saturn, which means responsibility is knocking at your door.

Love? Venus in Aries might make you feel like a warrior ready for battle, but remember, flirting with Mars in Leo could turn into a dramatic love triangle. <laugh> Career-wise, the Sun conjunct Uranus brings unexpected opportunities—maybe that promotion finally comes through! For well-being, the Sun sextile Neptune suggests some spiritual self-care is in order.

Cosmic Tip: Today’s astrological weather is like a wild party—enjoy the chaos but don’t forget to hydrate and take breaks. <sigh> And remember, Gemini, you’re the life of the party, so make sure your energy doesn’t get drained by all that cosmic drama.
