Buckle up, Gemini—today’s astrological weather is a cosmic rollercoaster! Mercury, your ruling planet, is in Taurus, making you as steady as a bull in a china shop. The Sun is trine the Moon, so expect some emotional stability. But watch out, because the Sun is also conjunct Uranus, which means unexpected twists are lurking around every corner.

In love, Venus in Aries might make you feel like fighting for your affection—literally. <chuckle> So, if someone’s flirting with you over oat milk again, it’s not just the caffeine talking.

Career-wise, the Sun sextile Saturn means you’re feeling grounded and ready to tackle any challenge. Just don’t let that Uranus energy make you too impulsive—you might end up quitting your job to become a professional clown. <laugh>

For well-being, the Sun trine Moon is a blessing in disguise. It’s like having a personal cheerleader who never stops believing in you.

Cosmic Tip: Embrace spontaneity but keep one foot on the ground. You’ll be surprised how much fun you can have without losing your mind.

So, Gemini, get ready for a day full of surprises and stability—it’s going to be a wild ride!
