Mars, your ruling planet, is in Leo, making you feel extra bold and dramatic. <laugh> Imagine Mars as the ultimate diva, strutting around with a cape, demanding attention. Today’s astrological weather is perfect for taking risks—especially in love. Venus in Aries means your charm is off the charts.
