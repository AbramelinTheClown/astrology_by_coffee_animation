Buckle up, Aries—it’s going to be a full-throttle Mars day! <chuckle> Today, the Sun is trine Moon, which means your inner warrior is ready to conquer the world. But hold onto your hats because Mercury in Taurus might make you feel like you’re wading through molasses when it comes to communication.

Mars, your ruling planet, is in Leo, so expect a burst of creative energy that’s as fiery as a dragon’s breath. <laugh> This could be the perfect day to start that passion project you’ve been putting off or finally speak up about something that’s been bugging you at work. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility—don’t go burning bridges just because you can.

Love is in the air thanks to Venus in Aries, but watch out for those Mars-in-Leo flares. You might be feeling extra passionate, but make sure your partner isn’t left feeling like they’re in a literal inferno. <sigh> As for career, Saturn in Pisces is giving you a boost of determination. Use this energy to tackle those big projects that have been gathering dust.

Cosmic Tip: Don’t let the Sun’s conjunction with Uranus make you too impulsive. Think before you act—unless you want to end up with a tattoo you’ll regret later. <laugh>

So, Aries, get ready to roar and shine bright like the star you are! And remember, if all else fails, just blame it on the planets.
