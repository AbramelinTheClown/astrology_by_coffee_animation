Buckle up, Gemini—it’s going to be a full-throttle Mercury day! <chuckle> Today, your ruling planet is in Taurus, which means you’re feeling grounded but also super communicative. The Sun is trine the Moon, so expect some emotional harmony. But watch out for that Uranus conjunction—the universe might throw a curveball or two.

Love: Venus in Aries is making things spicy. Expect some fiery conversations—maybe even a flirtatious argument over who gets the last slice of pizza. <laugh>

Career: With Jupiter in your sign, opportunities are knocking. Just don’t let that Sun-Uranus conjunction make you impulsive. Think before you leap into that new project.

Well-being: The Sun sextile Neptune means it’s a great day for some self-care. Maybe treat yourself to a spa day or just binge-watch your favorite show. <sigh>

Cosmic Tip: Mercury in Taurus loves stability, so stick to routines today. But don’t be afraid to shake things up a bit—just make sure you’ve got a solid plan.

So, Gemini, keep that Mercury energy flowing and enjoy the ride! Remember, every day is a new adventure in the cosmic dance. <laugh>
