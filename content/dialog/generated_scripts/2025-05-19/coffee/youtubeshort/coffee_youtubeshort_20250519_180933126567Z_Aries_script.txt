Buckle up, Aries—it’s a full-throttle Mars day! <chuckle> Today, the cosmos is serving up a cosmic smoothie of energy and ambition. Your ruling planet, Mars, is in Leo, so you’re feeling like the king or queen of the jungle. The Sun is trine Moon, which means your inner Taurus is harmonizing with your Capricorn moon. It’s like having a personal cheerleader who also happens to be a financial advisor.

Now, let’s talk about love. Venus in Aries means you’re feeling extra fiery and passionate. But watch out—Mercury in Taurus might make you say things like “I love you” when you really mean “I love your pizza.” <laugh> Career-wise, the Sun is sextile Saturn, so it’s a great day to tackle those big projects that have been sitting on your desk. Just don’t let Uranus in Taurus make you rebel against your boss by suggesting a company-wide nap time.

For well-being, the Sun conjunct Uranus means unexpected surprises are in store. Maybe you’ll find a hidden stash of chocolate or maybe you’ll discover you’ve been sleeping with a snake under your pillow. <sigh> Who knows? But remember, Aries, today is all about embracing that fiery energy and channeling it into something productive.

Cosmic Tip: Today’s planetary mood is like trying to eat a bowl of spicy ramen while riding a roller coaster. Embrace the chaos, but maybe skip the oat milk latte—it might end up in your chart instead of your cup. <chuckle>

And now, introducing Nebbles, my trusty sidekick with the purple cape! Nebbles: “Woof woof! Today is a great day to chase squirrels and bark at the mailman. Just remember, Aries, even if you feel like the king of the jungle, sometimes it’s okay to just be a dog in a cape.” <laugh>
