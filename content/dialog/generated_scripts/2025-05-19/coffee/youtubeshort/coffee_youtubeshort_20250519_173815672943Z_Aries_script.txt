Buckle up, Aries—it’s a full-throttle Mars day! <chuckle> Today, your ruling planet is in Leo, so expect some dramatic flair. The astrological weather? Well, the Sun is trine Moon, which means you’re feeling balanced and grounded. But watch out for that semisextile with Jupiter—someone’s about to have a big mouth moment.

Love: Venus is right there in your sign, Aries, so get ready for some fiery passion. Just don’t let Mars in Leo turn it into a dramatic love triangle. <laugh> Remember when I tried to bake a cake and ended up with a kitchen disaster? That’s what happens when you mix too many ingredients without knowing the recipe.

Career: With the Sun sextile Saturn, you’re feeling stable and focused. But don’t let that Uranus conjunction make you impulsive—you might end up quitting your job to become a professional clown. <sigh> Not that there’s anything wrong with clowning around.

Well-being: Neptune in Aries is making you feel extra intuitive today. Trust your gut, but don’t get lost in the fog of confusion. You know how I spilled coffee on my chart this morning? Well, now Neptune’s clearly in my 6th house of chaos. <laugh>

Cosmic Tip: Embrace the drama, Aries, but keep it under control. Today is all about balance and intuition.

Now, let me introduce you to Nebbles, my trusty sidekick with a purple cape. He has something to say too.

Nebbles: Woof! <bark> Today’s a great day for adventure, Aries! Just make sure to bring some treats along the way. <bark>
