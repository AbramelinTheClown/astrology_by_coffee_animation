Buckle up, Aries—it’s going to be a full-throttle Mars day! <chuckle> Today, May 17th, 2025, your ruling planet Mars is in Leo, which means you’re ready to roar like the king of the jungle. The astrological weather is all about stability and harmony with the Sun trine Moon, but don’t let that fool you—there’s a spark of chaos brewing.

The Sun is sextile Saturn, giving you a solid foundation for your ambitions. But watch out, because the Sun is also conjunct Uranus, which means unexpected twists are lurking around the corner. <laugh> This morning, I spilled coffee on my chart and now Neptune’s clearly in my 6th house of chaos.

In love, Venus in Aries is making you feel like a magnet for romance. But be careful—Mars in Leo might make you act more like a lion than a lover. Career-wise, the Sun sextile Saturn aspect means it’s time to get serious about your goals. Well-being? The Sun trine Moon brings a sense of balance and harmony.

Cosmic Tip: Embrace the unexpected today, Aries. You never know when a sudden twist might lead you to something amazing. <sigh>

Now, let me introduce Nebbles, my trusty sidekick with the purple cape. He’s got some words of wisdom for you too. Nebbles? Take it away!

Nebbles: Woof woof! Today is all about embracing your inner lion, Aries. Roar loud and proud, but remember to keep your heart open for love. <laugh> And don’t forget to take a nap—even lions need their beauty sleep.
